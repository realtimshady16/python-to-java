##The Goal

when running the main.py file, the user will be asked for a filename to convert. 
when a .py file is entered, the user will be asked for a file name for the "translated" .java file

a .java file should be created with minimal errors

##How it's going

- can insert the class of the file_name and the main method
- can translate a simple println statement
- can translate variables that are initialised and declared in the same line
